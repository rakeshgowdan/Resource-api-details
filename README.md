𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝐚𝐧 𝗔𝗣𝗜 ?

An Application Programming Interface, or API, is a means of communication between various software services. In this communication, the software sending requests is referred to as a client, and the software receiving and responding to those requests is referred to as a server. One analogy of this is the relationship displayed in the image below, in which the flower acts as the server, the hive acts as the client, and the bee acts as the API that facilitates communication through REST requests. There are different types of APIs.

▶️ 𝗦𝗢𝗔𝗣 - Supports a wide range of communication protocols found across the internet, such as HTTP, SMTP and TCP.
